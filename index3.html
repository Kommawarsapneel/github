        <h2>What is Front-End?</h2>
        <p>The front-end is the part of a website or app that users see and interact with directly. It's everything you experience visually, like the design, buttons, text, and images. Front-end development involves creating these elements using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the site look good and function properly.</p>
        <h3>How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Work:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML (Structure):</strong> HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. It creates the basic structure, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.<br>Example: It places text or images on the page.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS (Style):</strong> CSS makes the webpage look good. It adds colors, fonts, spacing, and controls the layout (how things are arranged).<br>Example: It changes the color of text, makes buttons look nicer, or arranges things in rows or columns.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript (Interactivity):</strong> JavaScript makes the webpage interactive. It allows actions like clicking buttons, showing messages, or updating information without reloading the page.<br>Example: When you click a button, JavaScript can show a message or change something on the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Cloud?</h2>
        <p>The cloud is like a big storage and computing space you can access online. Instead of storing files, running programs, or processing data on your personal device, you use the internet to access powerful systems that do this for you.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
            <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
            <li>Google Drive</li>
            <li>Dropbox</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is a Server?</h2>
        <p>A server is a powerful computer that stores, processes, and delivers information to other devices (like your phone or laptop).</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP Server</li>
            <li>Local Server</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is an IP Address?</h2>
        <p>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network (like the internet). It acts like a digital address, allowing devices to locate and communicate with each other.</p>
        <h3>Why is an IP Address Important?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Identification:</strong> Helps identify devices on a network.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Enables devices to send and receive data.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Access:</strong> Your public IP tells websites where to send requested data.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is a Browser?</h2>
        <p>A browser (short for web browser) is a software application that allows you to access and interact with websites on the internet. It acts as a gateway between you and the web, displaying content like text, images, videos, and more by interpreting website code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li>Opera</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is an API?</h2>
        <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allow two software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. It acts like a bridge, enabling one application to interact with another without needing to know the internal workings of the other app.</p>
        <h3>Real-Life Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Maps APIs</li>
            <li>Payment APIs</li>
            <li>Social Media APIs</li>
            <li>Weather APIs</li>
            <li>Messaging APIs</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Local Storage?</h2>
        <p>Local storage refers to a way of storing data on a device or within a browser, so that the data can persist even after the user closes the app or web page. It's used to save information that needs to be available locally (on the user's device) without constantly needing to retrieve it from a server.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is a Client?</h2>
        <p>In computing, a client is a device or software that interacts with a server to access services or resources. It’s essentially the "user" side of a client-server model, where the client makes requests to a server, and the server provides the requested data or service.</p>
        <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
        <p>Imagine a restaurant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Client:</strong> You (the customer) ordering food.</li>
            <li><strong>The Server:</strong> The waiter, who takes your order to the kitchen and brings the food back to you.</li>
            <li><strong>The Kitchen:</strong> The system (server) preparing the food based on the order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Static and Dynamic Web Pages</h2>
        <h3>Static Web Pages:</h3>
        <p>A static web page is a simple page where the content remains the same every time it is loaded, meaning it doesn’t change or respond to user interactions. It’s ideal for sites that don’t require frequent updates or customization, like informational websites or blogs.</p>
        <h3>Dynamic Web Pages:</h3>
        <p>A dynamic web page is one where the content is generated or updated in real-time based on user input, preferences, or other variables. It often involves interaction with a server or database, making it suitable for websites like social media, online stores, or news sites, where content frequently changes or needs to be personalized.</p>
